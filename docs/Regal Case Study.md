# Showtime App: Redefining Microinteractions for Moviegoers

- Right at the top

  - **Tools used:** Figma, Figmotion, Jitter, Adobe After Effects
  - **Duration:** Three months
  - **Roles:** Interaction Designer, UI Animator

## Overview

For my Interaction Design class, I reimagined the mobile app of a leading movie-ticketing service, focusing on how motion and feedback shape the user experience. The original app was functional but visually dull, with flat transitions and lifeless feedback. I renamed it **Showtime** and redesigned the flow with a black and red color scheme to emphasize its cinematic personality. My goal was to make the experience both smoother and more enjoyable; not just efficient, but entertaining.

> _This project is a conceptual redesign created for educational purposes only._

## The User and the Flow

**User Persona**  
**Jordan Reyes**, 27, is a marketing professional from Boston who loves unwinding with a movie after work. They value speed and simplicity but also notice when apps feel thoughtfully designed.

- **Needs:** A quick way to find movies, check showtimes, and buy tickets.
- **Pain Points:** Dated visuals and dull interactions that make the process feel routine.

The redesigned flow followed the main user journey:  
Home → Movie Selection → Seat Selection → Ticket Type → Checkout → Confirmation → Ticket Display.

Each screen received distinct motion feedback and visual polish to create a more cohesive, cinematic feel.

## Design Approach

### Rethinking Motion and Feedback

Every animation had intent — guiding attention, signaling success, or adding delight. I avoided purely decorative motion, instead designing feedback that made the experience feel alive while staying intuitive.

### Key Microinteractions

**Home Page**

- Introduced a **“Now Showing” film reel carousel** that scrolls horizontally with a subtle **projector light flicker** behind it.
- Added animated **category tabs** (“New Releases,” “Coming Soon,” “By Genre”) that raise and glow red when selected.

**Movie Page**

- Added a **trailer overlay** that expands from the poster with a glowing “theatre mode” effect.
- Replaced the standard date bar with a **scrollable ticket reel**, giving the UI a tactile, thematic touch.

**Seat Selection**

- Created a **responsive group size selector** that dynamically greys out incompatible seat clusters.
- Seat icons transition from gray to red when chosen, providing instant visual feedback.

**Ticket Selection**

- Added a **countdown timer** beside a bouncing film reel icon to convey urgency.
- Designed matching **seat and ticket counters** that must align before proceeding, visually placed inside IMAX 3D glasses for relevant showings.

**Checkout and Confirmation**

- Retained the timer for consistency.
- On confirmation, a short **popcorn-and-confetti animation** plays from the button, turning a routine step into a celebratory one.

**Ticket Display**

- Each ticket appears on a **digital stub**, filling the screen one at a time.
- When scanned or refunded, it **slides up and fades out**, as the next ticket moves into view.

**Loading Screen**

- Added a looping **ticket animation** that jumps and flips, making even waiting moments feel intentional.

## Process and Tools

All design and animation were created in **Figma**, with **Figmotion** and **Jitter** used for interactive previews. The loading animation was developed in **After Effects**, refining easing and timing for realism. The final high-fidelity prototype was presented in Figma as a complete user flow rather than a functional build.

## Outcome

The redesigned **Showtime** app transforms a standard ticketing experience into one that feels cohesive, lively, and personal. Every microinteraction reinforces the app’s theme — turning navigation into a narrative and small motions into moments of delight.

## Reflection

This project showed how small design details define how users feel. Motion can be more than decoration; it can communicate trust, anticipation, and excitement. Building Showtime strengthened my skills in interface animation, motion systems, and visual storytelling, while reinforcing that strong UX often lives in the smallest interactions.
