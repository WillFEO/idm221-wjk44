# Craigslist Usability Redesign: Improving an Outdated UI

- Right at the top

  - **Tools used:** Figma, Google Slides
  - **Duration:** One month
  - **Roles:** Usability Evaluator

## Overview

- For my Human-Computer Interaction final project, my team analyzed three pages of Craigslist to identify usability errors and redesign them for clarity and accessibility. Craigslist’s interface is famously cluttered and inconsistent, making it ideal for a usability overhaul.

## Problem

Craigslist’s outdated interface suffers from poor hierarchy, limited feedback, and inconsistent visual structure, making browsing and posting listings unnecessarily difficult. My goal was to modernize these pages while preserving the platform’s simple, community-driven identity.

## Research

I conducted a heuristic evaluation based on Jakob Nielsen’s usability heuristics and noted recurring complaints from online reviews. **The main usability themes were poor information hierarchy, low discoverability, and a lack of feedback mechanisms.** These findings shaped my redesign focus areas.

## Pages Evaluated & Key Issues

- The three Craigslist pages I analyzed were:
  - _The Home Page_ – suffers from poor information hierarchy and an unintuitive structure.
  - _A Product Listing Page_ – lacks key navigation aids and forces users to rely too much on memory.
  - _The Posting Form_ – has no error handling and lacks constraints to guide user input.

### Wireframe 1: Home Page – Conceptual Model

- Reorganized header to align with user expectations.
- Increased location prominence for easier regional browsing.
- Introduced collapsible category menus and capped visible listings for cleaner hierarchy.

### Wireframe 2: Product Listing Page – Knowledge in the Head vs. the World

- Added in-app messaging for direct contact with sellers.
- Implemented larger image carousel and improved breadcrumb navigation.

### Wireframe 3: Posting Form – Feedback & Constraints

- Added input prompts and live error feedback.
- Introduced dynamic dropdowns that disable incompatible options.
- Required completion of prerequisite fields before later sections unlock.

## Integrating UX Principles from Don Norman

- I applied concepts from The Design of Everyday Things throughout my redesign:
  - _Conceptual Models on the Home Page_ – Improved hierarchy and organization to align with user expectations.
  - _Knowledge in the Head vs. the World on the Product Page_ – Provided visual and interactive aids to reduce reliance on memory.
  - _Feedback & Constraints on the Posting Form_ – Implemented structured guidance and constraints to prevent errors.

## Impact and Reflection

- By focusing on usability principles and common pain points, my redesigns brought clarity, accessibility, and ease of use to Craigslist’s interface. This project reinforced my ability to analyze usability issues critically and propose effective design solutions, skills that are essential for my work in UX design.
