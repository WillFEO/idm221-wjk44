# Craigslist Usability Redesign: Improving an Outdated UI

- Right at the top

  - **Tools used:** Figma, Google Slides
  - **Duration:** Three months
  - **Roles:** Usability Evaluator

## Overview

- For my Human-Computer Interaction final project, I was placed in a team and tasked with evaluating three pages of a website for major usability errors and creating three improved wireframes to address those issues. We chose Craigslist due to its famously outdated UI and cluttered layout. While this was a group project, the majority of the work was completed independently, with only minor collaboration at the end to merge our results. Out of six group members, my product listing redesign was selected as one of the final three to be presented.

## Pages Evaluated & Key Issues

- The three Craigslist pages I analyzed were:
  - _The Home Page_ – suffers from poor information hierarchy and an unintuitive structure.
  - _A Product Listing Page_ – lacks key navigation aids and forces users to rely too much on memory.
  - _The Posting Form_ – has no error handling and lacks constraints to guide user input.

## Wireframe 1: Home Page – Conceptual Model

- _Header reorganized_ to fit user expectations.
- _Location given greater prominence,_ as Craigslist is a location-centered service.
- _Listing groups given clearer structure,_ with bold section headers in large font.
- _Collapsible menu system_ introduced for better navigation and hierarchy.
- _Capped number of displayed listings_ in each category, moving excess into a “More” menu.

## Wireframe 2: Product Listing Page - Knowledge in the Head vs. the World

- _In-app messaging system added,_ allowing users to contact sellers without leaving the page or switching between tabs.
- _Larger image carousel,_ displaying more visual details at once.
- _Breadcrumb navigation improved,_ making it clearer where users are and where they have been.

## Wireframe 3: Posting a Listing – Feedback & Constraints

- _Initial message clarifying input requirements,_ reducing user frustration.
- _Error messages introduced,_ guiding users when mistakes occur.
- _Dropdown menus that dynamically disappear,_ preventing incompatible choices.
- _Later sections greyed out until prerequisite fields are completed,_ preventing confusion.
- _Final prompt before submission,_ reminding users to review incomplete fields before continuing.

## Integrating UX Principles from Don Norman

- I applied concepts from The Design of Everyday Things throughout my redesign:
  - _Conceptual Models on the Home Page_ – Improved hierarchy and organization to align with user expectations.
  - _Knowledge in the Head vs. the World on the Product Page_ – Provided visual and interactive aids to reduce reliance on memory.
  - _Feedback & Constraints on the Posting Form_ – Implemented structured guidance and constraints to prevent errors.

## Impact and Reflection

- By focusing on usability principles and common pain points, my redesigns brought clarity, accessibility, and ease of use to Craigslist’s interface. This project reinforced my ability to analyze usability issues critically and propose effective design solutions, skills that are essential for my work in UX design.
