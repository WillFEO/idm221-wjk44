# Showtime App: Redefining Microinteractions for Moviegoers

- Right at the top

  - **Tools used:** Figma, Figmotion, Jitter, Adobe After Effects
  - **Duration:** Three months
  - **Roles:** Interaction Designer, UI Animator

## Overview

For my Interaction Design class, I reimagined the mobile app of a leading movie-ticketing service, focusing on how motion and feedback shape the user experience. I rebranded it as **Showtime** and redesigned the flow to emphasize its cinematic personality.

## Problem

The original app offered functional features — browsing, seat selection, payment — but lacked proper motion feedback and polish. Users had little sense of responsiveness or delight.

## Research

I conducted a short competitive review of major cinema and streaming apps (AMC, Fandango, Netflix) to study how animation contributes to engagement and clarity.

## Design Approach

### Rethinking Motion and Feedback

Every animation had intent — guiding attention, signaling success, or adding delight. I avoided purely decorative motion, instead designing feedback that made the experience feel alive while staying intuitive.

### Key Microinteractions

- **Home:** “Now Showing” reel carousel with projector flicker
- **Movie Page:** Expanding trailer overlay and scrollable ticket reel
- **Seat Selection:** Group-size responsive map
- **Checkout:** “It’s Showtime” button triggers a popcorn celebration
- **Ticket Display:** Animated transitions between scanned tickets

## Video Demo

This video shows a user progression through my entire prototype.

## Process and Tools

All design and animation were created in **Figma**, with **Figmotion** and **Jitter** used for interactive previews. The loading animation was developed in **After Effects**.

## Outcome

The redesign transforms a static experience into one that feels cohesive, intuitive, and playful. Each motion reinforces usability while reflecting the joy of going to the movies.

## Reflection

This project showed how small design details define how users feel. Building Showtime strengthened my skills in interface animation, motion systems, and visual storytelling, while reinforcing that strong UX often lives in the smallest interactions.
