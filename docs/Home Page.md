# **About Me**

Hello world, I’m William Kalb! I’m a User Experience and Interaction Design major at Drexel University in Philadelphia, where I’m learning about the psychology, design, and development processes behind everyday products, both physical and digital.

I am from a small town in Pennsylvania, where I attended high school at the George School in Newtown, PA. I am an Eagle Scout from Troop 230 of Yardley, PA. In my free time I enjoy reading, spending time with animals, and being outside in almost any capacity. My strongest passions are hiking/climbing up mountains, and any thrilling activities like skydiving and roller coasters.

I take pride in my focus on exactitude in my designs, my eagerness and ability to learn new skills quickly, and my interpersonal skills. I have developed my passion for art, design, and computer science throughout high school, and through my degree program at Drexel I am learning more about all of these skills in a multidisciplinary context.
