# West Hollywood DMV Redesign: A User-Centered Approach to Efficiency and Comfort

  - **Tools used:** Miro, Discord, Physical crafts tools (Box cutters, rulers, pencils)
  - **Duration:** Three months
  - **Roles:** Prototyping Co-leader, Prototype Designer

## Overview

For our final project in my Design Thinking in Production class, our class operated as a full-scale design agency, collaborating across multiple departments to tackle a notoriously frustrating user experience: the DMV. After selecting the West Hollywood DMV as our focus, we formed teams specializing in UX research, UX design, storytelling, concept development, and prototyping—where I played a key role.

## Project Vision: A Smarter, More Engaging DMV Experience

DMVs are infamous for inefficiency, long wait times, and uncomfortable environments. Our goal was to transform the West Hollywood DMV into a space that maximized efficiency, improved user flow, and created a more pleasant waiting experience. Through extensive brainstorming, our key redesign principles emerged:

- _Optimized floorspace_ with clear branding, featured collections, and prominent search functionality.
- _Increased natural light_ to enhance ambiance and reduce stress.
- _Smarter seating arrangements_ that allow for comfort and efficiency.
- _A built-in café,_ capitalizing on expected wait times by offering a more engaging, revenue-generating experience.
- _A kiosk system_ to streamline both DMV check-in and café ordering, reducing the need for staff intervention and improving overall service flow.

## Our Role as the Prototyping Team

As the prototyping department, our objectives were clear:

- Construct a _scaled model_ of the current DMV layout.
- Develop _small-scale elements_ to visualize our proposed changes.
- _Prototype one full-scale object,_ selected in agreement with all teams.
- _Create detailed floorplan designs_ to reflect our redesign vision.

Our team determined that the most impactful object to prototype at full scale was the _self-service kiosk,_ a critical element of our user experience overhaul.

## My Personal Contributions

In our four-person prototyping team, I took on a central role in the _design and construction_ of the full-scale kiosk prototype. My key contributions included:

- _Designing the kiosk from the ground up,_ including calculating all measurements and dimensions to ensure ergonomic and accessible use.
- _Researching and sourcing materials,_ purchasing all necessary supplies including cardboard, foam board, tape, and adhesives within an $80 budget.
- _Leading construction efforts,_ guiding my teammates in understanding the design vision and ensuring accurate cutting and assembly of components.
- _Ensuring accessibility compliance,_ incorporating research on wheelchair heights, standing comfort, and motor control accommodations into the design.

## Designing an Accessible, Dual-Purpose Kiosk

To create a more inclusive and efficient kiosk, we researched accessibility standards, including wheelchair height guidelines, standing height considerations, and ergonomic controls. Key features of our prototype included:

- _Weighted stand with an extended arm,_ allowing wheelchair users to roll underneath or approach from the side.
- _Touchscreen display with a tactile keyboard,_ ensuring precision for all users.
- _Joystick-based navigation,_ accommodating users with motor control challenges.
- _Adjustable screen angle,_ via a slider system behind the screen.
- _Two physical buttons for navigation,_ marked with a car icon (for DMV services) and a coffee cup icon (for café orders), enabling an intuitive switching mechanism.
- _Thematic idle screens,_ with café kiosks displaying cascading coffee beans and DMV kiosks featuring license plate graphics, subtly guiding users to the correct service point.

## Collaboration and Iteration

Throughout the project, our team maintained close communication with other departments, ensuring our prototype aligned with research insights and design goals. Regular feedback loops allowed us to refine our kiosk and adjust the floorplan model as necessary. We adapted our approach as new information arose, ensuring that the final design was as practical as it was innovative.

## Outcome and Impact

Our redesigned DMV concept successfully reimagined an often-overlooked government space. By focusing on user needs, accessibility, and a more engaging environment, our team demonstrated how human-centered design can drastically improve even the most mundane experiences. This project was an incredible opportunity to work within a large, multidisciplinary team, refining not only my prototyping skills but also my ability to adapt, collaborate, and execute a user-first vision.
