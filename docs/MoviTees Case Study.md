# MoviTees Website Redesign

- Right at the top

  - **Tools used:** Figma, User Research, Wireframing, Prototyping, UI Design, Usability Testing
  - **Duration:** Six months
  - **Roles:** UX Designer, UI Designer, Researcher

## Overview

MoviTees is a movie-inspired apparel company with strong branding but poor usability. Over six months, I redesigned their website to improve navigation, hierarchy, and shopping flow while preserving the brand’s subtle, fan-driven aesthetic.

## The Problems

The site’s structure made browsing and purchasing difficult: unclear organization, missing search and filters, and text-heavy product pages created friction for new users.

**Goal:** make shopping intuitive and visually engaging while maintaining the brand’s tone.

## My Approach

### User Research and Analysis

I conducted an analysis of reviews, a heuristic evaluation, and a card-sorting exercise to identify navigation pain points.

**Findings:** Users valued nostalgia and design quality but were frustrated by long scrolls, hidden sizing guides, and a lack of search.

### Design and Prototyping

Using Figma, I developed wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

**Key features:**

- Redesigned homepage with featured collections and clear branding
- Horizontal “Choose a Movie” browsing system
- Simplified product pages with essential info and dropdown sizing guide
- Functional cart and streamlined checkout

Throughout the process, I leveraged Figma's Auto Layout, components, variables, animations, and prototyping features to create a scalable and flexible design system.

## Key Improvements

- _Added search functionality and filtering options_ to improve navigation.
- _Reorganized information hierarchy_ to prioritize essential details.
- _Restructured the “Choose a Movie” page_ into a horizontal layout for better usability.
- _Refined UI elements and visual balance_ for a cohesive, modern aesthetic.
- _Condensed large blocks of text_ into dropdowns and easily digestible lists.
- _Brought a dropdown system to the sizing chart_ to allow users to find their desired information with much less confusion.
