# MoviTees Website Redesign

- Right at the top

  - **Tools used:** Figma, User Research, Wireframing, Prototyping, UI Design, Usability Testing
  - **Duration:** Six months
  - **Roles:** UX Designer, UI Designer, Researcher

## Overview

MoviTees is a niche merchandise company that designs, produces, and sells apparel featuring in-universe logos from popular movies. Their products are for dedicated movie fans who appreciate subtle, high-quality designs that feel like insider references. However, despite the company’s strong branding and product quality, its website suffers from major usability issues that hinder the shopping experience. **PARAGRAPH BREAK** I spent six months redesigning the MoviTees website by conducting user research and creating wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes for desktop, tablet, and mobile. My redesign focused on improving navigation, information hierarchy, and overall usability while maintaining the company’s established aesthetic.

## The Problems

- Lack of Search and Navigation Tools
  - No search functionality or filtering options, making it difficult to browse products efficiently.
  - The “Choose a Movie” page required excessive vertical scrolling, slowing down the user experience.
- Poor Information Organization
  - Product pages lacked essential details about the designs but had overwhelming, unnecessary text on fabric specifications.
  - The homepage failed to introduce the brand, featuring only images without product names or context.
  - The sizing chart was hard to find and took users to a lengthy and confusing page.
- Inefficient Layout and UI Design
  - The homepage displayed seemingly random products without clear guidance.
  - Product images stacked vertically, requiring unnecessary scrolling.
  - Navigation paths were unclear, leading to frustration for first-time users.

## My Approach

### User Research and Analysis

To better understand MoviTees’ users, I conducted a detailed analysis of customer reviews. Patterns emerged: many buyers were middle-aged, family-oriented, and motivated by nostalgia, product quality, and the “in-the-know” appeal of the designs. Based on these insights, I created a user persona, Christopher Smith, to guide my design decisions.

I then conducted:

- _Card sorting excercises_ to optimize the site's information architecture
- _Usability Heuristic evaluations_ on my redesign to find any issues or pain points

### Design and Prototyping

Using Figma, I developed wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes for key pages, focusing on a smooth path from landing on the site to completing a purchase.

My designs included:

- _A redesigned homepage_ with clear branding, featured collections, and prominent search functionality.
- _A "Choose a Movie" page_ structured horizontally for easier browsing.
- _A movie-specific product page_ allowing users to choose any products themed around a specific movie.
- _Refined product pages_ with prioritized information, including product names, design descriptions, and clear call-to-action buttons.
- _A dedicated sizing guide_ embedded within product pages for easy access.
- _A functional cart system_ ith clear item details and quantity changing options.
- _A streamlined checkout experience_ with an intuitive step-by-step process.

Throughout the process, I leveraged Figma's Auto Layout, components, variables, animations, and prototyping features to create a scalable and flexible design system.

## Key Improvements

- _Added search functionality and filtering options_ to improve navigation.
- _Reorganized information hierarchy_ to prioritize essential details.
- _Restructured the “Choose a Movie” page_ into a horizontal layout for better usability.
- _Refined UI elements and visual balance_ for a cohesive, modern aesthetic.
- _Condensed large blocks of text_ into dropdowns and easily digestible lists.
- _Brought a dropdown system to the sizing chart_ to allow users to find their desired information with much less confusion.

## Outcome

The redesigned MoviTees website provides a vastly improved user experience while preserving the brand’s identity. The new layout enhances usability, streamlines the shopping journey, and ensures that both new and returning customers can easily find and purchase products.

This project reinforced my skills in UX research, information architecture, and interface design while deepening my expertise in Figma and design systems. Most importantly, it demonstrated the impact of thoughtful UX improvements on a real-world business.

## Next Steps and Reflection

While the redesign addressed major usability concerns, future iterations could explore additional personalization features, such as recommended products based on past purchases or a “Favorites” list. Continued user testing would further refine the experience.
