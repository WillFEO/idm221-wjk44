      <section id="overview">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          For our final project in my Design Thinking in Production class, our
          class operated as a full-scale design agency to tackle a notoriously
          frustrating user experience: the DMV. After selecting the West
          Hollywood DMV as our focus, we formed teams specializing in UX
          research, UX design, storytelling, concept development, and
          prototyping — where I played a key role.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="problem">
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Long waits, unclear navigation, and uncomfortable environments make
          DMVs synonymous with frustration. We set out to understand the root
          causes of this negative experience and redesign the space to better
          support both users and staff.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="research">
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
          This project provided the unique experience of having a UX Research
          "department" working alongside us. This allowed my prototyping
          department to devote our full focus to solving the issues they gave
          us.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="project-vision">
        <h2>Project Vision</h2>
        <p>
          Our goal was to transform the West Hollywood DMV into a space that
          maximized efficiency, improved user flow, and created a more pleasant
          waiting experience. Through extensive brainstorming, our key redesign
          principles emerged:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Increased natural light to enhance ambiance and reduce stress</li>
          <li>
            Smarter seating arrangements that allow for comfort and efficiency
          </li>
          <li>
            A built-in café, capitalizing on expected wait times by offering a
            more engaging, revenue-generating experience
          </li>
          <li>
            A kiosk system to streamline both DMV check-in and café ordering,
            reducing the need for staff intervention and improving overall
            service flow.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section id="my-role">
        <h2>My Role: Prototyping</h2>
        <h3>The Team</h3>
        <p>
          Our four-person prototyping team created a scaled model of the DMV and
          a full-scale interactive kiosk prototype — the centerpiece of the
          redesigned service flow.
        </p>
        <h3>My Personal Contributions</h3>
        <p>
          In our four-person prototyping team, I took on a central role in the
          design and construction of the full-scale kiosk prototype. My key
          contributions included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Designing the kiosk from the ground up, calculating ergonomic
            dimensions for accessibility
          </li>
          <li>Researching and sourcing materials within an $80 budget</li>
          <li>
            Leading construction efforts, guiding my teammates in understanding
            the design vision and ensuring accurate assembly of components
          </li>
          <li>
            Ensuring accessibility compliance for both wheelchair and standing
            users
          </li>

        <h2>The Kiosk</h2>
        <p>
          To create a more inclusive and efficient kiosk, we researched
          accessibility standards, including wheelchair height guidelines,
          standing height considerations, and ergonomic controls. Key features
          of our prototype included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Weighted stand with an extended arm, allowing wheelchair users to
            roll underneath or approach from the side
          </li>
          <li>
            Touchscreen display with a tactile keyboard, ensuring precision for
            all users
          </li>
          <li>
            Joystick-based navigation, accommodating users with motor control
            challenges
          </li>
          <li>Adjustable screen angle via a slider system behind the screen</li>
          <li>
            Two physical buttons for navigation, marked with a car icon (for DMV
            services) and a coffee cup icon (for café orders), enabling an
            intuitive switching mechanism.
          </li>
          <li>
            Thematic idle screens, with café kiosks displaying cascading coffee
            beans and DMV kiosks featuring license plate graphics, subtly
            guiding users to the correct service point.

      <section id="outcome">
        <h2>Collaboration and Outcome</h2>
        <p>
          Close coordination between departments ensured consistency across
          research and design. Our prototype demonstrated how small physical
          changes can redefine public service experiences, making them more
          efficient and humane. This project strengthened my collaboration and
          prototyping skills while showing how UX principles extend beyond
          digital products.
